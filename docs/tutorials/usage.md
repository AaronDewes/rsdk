# Basic usage

`rsdk` comes with `bash-completion` to assist its CLI usage.

After typing `rsdk` into your terminal, if there is no subcommand suggestion after you press Tab key twice, you should run `rsdk shell` to enter the development environment.

From there, you can use autocompletion to query the supported command list.

Running a command without any argument will display its help text.
