# `rsdk`

`rsdk` is the latest system development kit from Radxa.

It is built upon our previous experiences with [`rbuild`](https://github.com/radxa-repo/rbuild)
and [`debos-radxa`](https://github.com/radxa/debos-radxa), while also adds many other utilities
to improve the developer / maintainer experience.
